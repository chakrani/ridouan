Play-by-mail games, or play-by-post games, are games, of any type, played through postal mail or email.
Correspondence chess has been played by mail for centuries. The boardgame Diplomacy has been played by mail since 1963,  starting with a printed newsletter  written by John Boardman. More complex games, moderated entirely or partially by computer programs, were pioneered by Rick Loomis of Flying Buffalo in  1970.  The first such game offered via major email services was WebWar II  from Neolithic Enterprises who accepted email turns from all of the major email services including CompuServe in 1983.
Play by mail games are often referred to as PBM games, and play by email is sometimes abbreviated PBeM—as opposed to face to face  or over the board  games which are played in person. Another variation on the name is play-by-Internet  or play-by-web . In all of these examples, player instructions can be either executed by a human moderator, a computer program, or a combination of the two.
In the 1980s, play-by-mail games reached their peak of popularity with the advent of Gaming Universal, Paper Mayhem and Flagship magazine, the first professional magazines devoted to play-by-mail games.  Bob McLain, the publisher and editor of Gaming Universal, further popularized the hobby by writing articles that appeared in many of the leading mainstream gaming magazines of the time. Flagship later bought overseas right to Gaming Universal, making it the leading magazine in the field. Flagship magazine was founded by Chris Harvey and Nick Palmer. 
In the late 1990s, computer and Internet games marginalized play-by-mail conducted by actual postal mail, but the postal hobby still exists with an estimated 2000–3000 adherents worldwide.
Postal gaming developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other.  
Chess is the oldest play-by-mail game. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by postal mail. In this two player game, players send their moves to each other alternately. Multi-player games emerged later. Diplomacy is an example of this type in which a central game master manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. Diplomacy was first played by mail in 1963.  In the early 1970s, in the United States, Rick Loomis, of Flying Buffalo Inc, began a number of play-by-mail games;  this included games such as Nuclear Destruction, which launched in 1970. 
This began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as Battleplan, Heroic Fantasy, Starweb, and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.  For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until Schubel &amp; Son entered the field in "roughly" 1976 with the human-moderated Tribes of Crane game.  Schubel &amp; Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. This provided players with larger bankrolls the advantage or the ability to abuse game systems. 
The next "big entrance" was Superior Simulations with its game Empyrean Challenge in 1978.  Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was "the most complex game system on Earth" with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.  By 1980, the PBM field was growing but still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones.  The most popular games of 1980 were Starweb and Tribes of Crane.  

Some players, unhappy with their experiences with Schubel &amp; Son and Superior Simulations, launched their own company  and game, Beyond the Stellar Empire, which became "immensely popular".  In this same way, many people have launched PBM companies, trying their hand at finding the right mix of action and strategy for the gaming audience of the period. According to Jim Townsend:
